This bot is for the messaging app Telegram.

"Spotted" is a thing in the communication channel/group chat of a group of people. The way "spotted" it works is that if a person in the group (Alice) *spots* another person in the group (Bob) in real life, Alice will take a picture of Bob with her phone and post it onto their common group, thus "spotting" Bob. There isn't really much of a point in doing so, just trivial lighthearted fun. But it does get pretty interesting and exciting when say, its a sizeable college friend group during the school semester.

This bot is to help facilitate and track "spotted" on Telegram group chats. The bot detects when a valid spot is made, and tracks how many times a user has spotted someone or been spotted (caught) by someone else.
